# 1. c = getchar() != EOF

If an user input EOF (C-d), it assigns 0 to the variable c . Otherwise, assigns 1.

# 2. Why getchar is int type

To accept EOF, which is 0xFFFFFFFF.

# 3. i++ vs ++i

Prefix ++i increases the variable then evaluate the result. Suffix i++ returns the value first, then increase it. For instance, when i has been set 1, j = ++i makes j 2, j = i++ makes j 1, and i will be 2 in both cases.

# 6. i = i++

Undefined. :)

# 5. Definition of String in C Language

String is created as an array of char type.

# 6. What happens when you give getline chars 'a', 'b', 'c', and EOF
